# genomics 

Tools for some a friend working on genomics.

For now this is going to be a bit of a playground. He had a set of steps
his colleagues would use  to pull down some data and then move it to S3 in
AWS from a website.

## Goals:

1. Create a staging environment to run this on AWS instance.
1. Automate the steps in bash and time the steps.
1. Automate the steps in another language (probably golang) for better efficiency and performance
1. Automate the testing
